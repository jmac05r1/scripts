Zabbix Web Scenario Trigger Notes 
Goal
Monitor a website (https://example.com) using a Zabbix web scenario with:

Scenario name: website_health_check_site

Step name: website availability

Expected HTTP response code: 200 OK

We want a single trigger that alerts when:

The site returns any HTTP response code other than 200

OR the site is completely unreachable (timeout, SSL error, DNS failure, etc.)

Combined Trigger Expression (Zabbix 6.4+ Syntax)

last(/Web-Monitor/web.test.rspcode[website_health_check_site,website availability])<>200
or
last(/Web-Monitor/web.test.fail[website_health_check_site])<>0
Replace Web-Monitor with the exact name of the host that owns the web scenario.

üîé What Each Condition Means
Expression	Meaning
last(...rspcode...)<>200	Zabbix got a response, but it's not 200 (e.g. 403, 500, 301)
last(...fail...)<>0	The web scenario failed to reach the site at all (e.g. timeout, SSL error, DNS fail)
Auto-Resolution Behavior
This trigger will automatically resolve when:
The site returns HTTP 200, and
The scenario is no longer failing
So when the site is back up and healthy, the trigger clears on its own.

Suggested Trigger Name
Website Health Check Failed: Bad HTTP Code or Site Unreachable (https://example.com)

### Trigger testing w/expression ###
Scenario	Last Response Code	Expression Result	Trigger Fires?
Site returns 200	200	false	‚ùå No "will not fire trigger"
Site returns 500	500	true	‚úÖ Yes "will fire trigger"
Site unreachable (no response)	still 200 (unchanged)	false	‚ùå No ‚Äî but you need a separate trigger for this
