This script checks EC2 instances, NAT gateways, and network interfaces for the specified private/public IP address. The grep command checks if the IP address is present in the output of the AWS CLI commands. If it is, the script prints a message and exits. If the IP address isn't found in any of the checked resources, the script prints "IP address not found".
